TCPclient.py = a Basic TCP Client that can allow you to test for services, send data, fuzz and many other tasks.

TCPserver.py = a Basic TCP Server that if used in conjunction with TCPclient.py can show you can the output of a basic server connection. You can use this when writing command shells or a proxy. (Will not work for a reverse-shell... yet!)

TCPproxy.py = a Basic TCP proxy that allows forwarding traffic to bounce from host to host.
